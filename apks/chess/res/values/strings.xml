    <string name="elo_help"><b>ELO rating system:</b>"

The game in \"Pro\" mode will calculate an ELO rating for you, after you have played 5 games. Note that this is based on the FIDE version of ELO and will give a good ELO rating within the app. Each CPU difficulty level in the game has a tested rating. We have set CPU Level 12 at FIDE ELO 2100 (but it might be higher), with Level 1 at 750.

However note that this will not exactly match with the ELO used in human tournaments, for the following reasons:

1. FIDE ELO and USCF would normally calculate ELO ratings from controlled timed events, but Chess Free has a more relaxed control that allows the user to take as long as they like. So the rating you receive might be higher than a human tournament rating.

2. Computer ELO does not always match up well with human ELO, so that some players may find a program is stronger than it claims whereas others will feel it is much weaker. This is because of the computer style. Humans that often play Chess programs will find quirks in the AI that they can exploit to get better results.

3. FIDE, USCF and other ELO scales differ in standard, so that, for example, USCF may differ by some 100 ELO points from FIDE.

4. There will be some variation in strength between devices. For the lower levels this will be the same on any handset, but for a fraction of moves on the higher levels a fast device will play better.

This ELO system accurately follows FIDE ELO rating changes within the app, so you will be able to track the relative change in your strength. This will allow you to develop as a player and have an idea of how well you are doing.

(Note: The \"Casual\" mode scoring system is not ELO but a simpler cumulative scoring system based on your results against all levels.)"</string>

    <string name="help1">GAME RULES</string>
    <string name="help2">"The game of Chess is a battle between two players, who take it in turns to move their pieces, white and black. Pieces are moved either to an empty square or to a square occupied by an opponent piece which is then captured and removed from the board. The ultimate object of the game is to checkmate the opponent’s King so that it cannot escape, but this is preceded by careful manoeuvring of pieces designed to control space and gain material, and so strengthen the final attack.

Traditionally the pieces in Chess represent aspects of medieval society. The following sections describe how these pieces move."</string>
    <string name="help3">"The 8 Pawns symbolise labourers or soldiers. They move in a forward direction, one square at a time. On its first move the Pawn can also optionally move forward two squares. These forward moves cannot be capture moves. Instead Pawns capture pieces in a forward-diagonal direction, but cannot otherwise move this way. When a Pawn reaches the other end of the board it can be changed for any other piece of its own colour, except the King of course. This is called promotion. Normally a Pawn is promoted to a Queen.

The Pawn has one extra move: the en-passant rule. This states that a double Pawn move can be immediately captured by an opponent's Pawn, if that Pawn is adjacent to the double Pawn move after the move (on its 5th rank). In practice this means that the opponent can play the normal capture that would have been available if the Pawn had only advanced one square. On the board the en-passant capture moves the capturing Pawn behind the double-move Pawn, and then removes it."</string>
    <string name="help4">The Knight’s motion is unusual: it does not move in a straight line, but makes a double move, with a single straight and single diagonal move. This L-shaped move can be in any direction, giving 8 possible moves when the Knight is near the centre of the board. Similar to a real horse, Knights can jump over Chess pieces of the same or opposite colour. If the Knight starts off on a light square, it will finish its move on a dark square.</string>
    <string name="help5">The Bishop can move any number of squares in a diagonal direction. It cannot jump pieces as the Knight can.</string>
    <string name="help6">The Rook can move any number of squares in a horizontal or vertical direction. It cannot jump pieces as the Knight can.</string>
    <string name="help7">The Queen has the ability to move in a horizontal, vertical or diagonal path across any number of spaces as long as she is not blocked. The Queen therefore combines the moves of the Rook and Bishop. The Queen is a formidable piece, and will often be central in attacks.</string>
    <string name="help8">"The King is the main object of your opponent's attacks. Once checkmated, the game is over! It can move in all possible eight diagonal and horizontal directions, but only one square at a time. The King also has a special Castling move, where it can move two squares to left or right, with the Rook jumping over it to occupy the square on the other side of the King."</string>
    <string name="help9">"This is only legal if the King and Rook have not moved previously, none of the squares between the Rook and King are blocked, the king is not in check and none of the squares the King passes through are attacked by enemy pieces. The King needs to be protected, but can also become a powerful attacking piece. In the end game it will offer a formidable attacking piece against enemy Pawns. In simple mating endgames, it will form part of the mating attack.

When the King is being attacked directly by an opponent's piece, we say that the King is in check. If the King is in check it must be made safe immediately.

There are 3 ways to get out of check:

1. The King may move to a square that is not being attacked by an enemy piece.

2. The piece that is attacking the King can be captured.

3. A piece may be moved between the King and the enemy piece to block the check.

If the King is in check and cannot get out, then we say the King is checkmated and the game is lost."</string>
    <string name="helpmain1">HOW TO PLAY</string>
    <string name="helpmain2">"(Scroll down for Chess rules)

Before starting a game, you will be presented with a Match Settings screen. From here you can choose the side to play as (or have it alternate each game), the CPU difficulty (1 for beginners, and 12 for experts), the white handicap (a white piece removed to aid black), and the game timer parameters.

There are two elements to the timers:

GAME TIMER determines the initial amount of time given to each player before the match. This counts down whilst a player is thinking about their moves, and they will instantly lose the match if it reaches zero.

MOVE TIMER is the bonus time given to a player after making a move.

Once a game has started, use the touch-screen or the dpad/joystick on the phone to select and move pieces. A piece is moved by first selecting it, then selecting a legal square to move to.

The Undo button can be used to take back as many moves as you want.

Player names, timers, taken pieces and CHECK notifications are displayed above and below the board. When the CPU is thinking about a move, an animation will play in the top right. Note that the higher the CPU difficulty, the longer the thinking times will be. If timers are active, the CPU will cut short its thinking if necessary.

During play, you can press the phone's MENU button to get access to two useful features. HINT will tell the CPU to assess your current situation and suggest a move. REVIEW GAME will take you to another screen with a moves list where you'll be able to view all moves played up to that point. The moves list is scrollable, and selecting a move will jump to that point. You can also use the navigation buttons on the left to cycle through moves one at a time, or jump to the start and end of the move history.

SAVE &amp; QUIT is always available under the MENU button - this will save any progress or settings changes you've made, and then exit.

"<b>STATISTICS:</b>"

The game will track your wins/losses/draws against each of the CPU levels. This information can be accessed from the title menu screen. The rating shown in the bottom left of the stats page is a cumulative rating calculated from all your games (This is not an ELO rating.) Win percentage counts 1 point for win and 0.5 points for draw. Note that Handicap games will not count towards these statistics.

"<b>TUTOR (from Match Settings or Options):</b>"

Chess now has an optional tutor to help choose your move. When turned on, this automatically recommends a piece that you could move, but not where you should move it to. It therefore assists in your choice, but does not offer an exact move, so you are \"helped\" in your selection but still obliged to consider the move. Of course you can still choose HINT (?) or even ANALYSE from the MENU for exact recommendations.

This partial advice approach can help you avoid simple mistakes while also giving a nudge of how to proceed in the position.

Note, you don't have to accept the tutor's recommendation: it is simply a \"good\" choice but a better move may be available.

You can also change the tutor level in options screen. By default the program picks a tutor level to match your opponent CPU difficulty, so that it gives advice quickly but takes longer for higher levels. However you may want the tutor to think for longer to give you deeper help. You can set this to levels between 1 and 8, where 8 takes a particularly long time. Note that you can always interrupt the tutor at any time by touching the screen, after which the tutor will offer its advice immediately.

"<b>SHOW PIECES IN DANGER (from Options):</b>"

You can choose to \"Show Pieces In Danger\", so that the program will place a red highlight behind pieces that can be safely captured by the opponent. This can also help you learn to avoid mistakes.

"<b>OUR CHESS PROGRAM:</b>"

Our Chess program is based on our Treebeard chess engine, which you can read about on http://www.aifactory.co.uk/newsletter/2005_02_treebeard_chess.htm and that has been licensed for use by Microsoft in their products.

This game now supports the Heyzap games network, which allows you to optionally log to twitter or facebook when you win games. Heyzap allows you to see what games your friends are playing and for you to log achievements (badges) and share tips.
